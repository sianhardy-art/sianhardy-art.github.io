### sian hardy (she/her/they/them) is an emerging visual artist currently living and working on Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country. 

<p> my practice is predominantly grounded in painting and ceramics, as well as elements of drawing, textiles and photographic processes. i am interested in developing creative methodologies that enable iterative investigations into relationships with place and with Country. this includes immersive, place-based research, alongside studio-based explorations of materiality and imagery. </p>


<p> i am a settler on this continent, tracing my family history back to settler-colonisers from Britain and Ireland who arrived on unceded Aboriginal lands in the mid 19th century. i acknowledge and pay my respects to the Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri, and the Pitjantjatjara peoples upon whose lands i have lived, worked and learned. </p>
